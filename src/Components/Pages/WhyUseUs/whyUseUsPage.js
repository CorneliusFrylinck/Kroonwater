                The activated carbon used in the different filters is coconut shell carbon. Coconut shell carbon is a much more effective and more expensive carbon than coal-based carbon, but most importantly is safe to use. 
                <p>Coal-based carbon is prone to leach dangerous heavy metals into the water, which is especially dangerous to use in the taste and odour filter. </p>
                <p>Coal-based carbon is also not effective in the removal of endocrine disrupting hormones. </p>
                <p className='description-heading bold'>The biggest advantages of the Hydro Wellness RO is the pre-filter size: </p>

                    <li>The 15% bigger filter provides the client with an extended lifetime on the filters as well as better protection to the membrane </li>
                    <li>The plastic plate at the bottom of the 5 micron filter ensures that the filters seal more securely and reduces the risk of water bypassing the filter. </li>
                </ul>
